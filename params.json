{"name":"SignalIntensity","tagline":"Minimalist signal strength meter for Android","body":"# Signal Intensity\r\nMinimalist Android app to show the strength of your wifi signal. Available on the Play Store: [Signal Intensity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.victorszeto.signalintensity)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/images/strongsignal.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\" />\r\n<img src=\"/images/weaksignal.png?raw=true\" width=\"50%\" />\r\n\r\n## What is this\r\nDisplays the RSSI (relative signal strength indicator) detected by your phone, with a percentage of \"maximum\" (according to Android's `WifiManager`) possible RSSI. The background color changes depending on how strong your signal is.\r\n\r\n## How to read\r\nRSSI is a negative number between -100 and -55. The higher the number, the stronger the signal.\r\nThe background colour is an interpolated color between blue and red. Blue means weak signal, red means strong signal.\r\n\r\n## Why do I need this\r\nUseful for looking for WiFi \"dead zones\" in a room, or finding places where the signal is strongest when you're in a place with a flaky/weak wifi connection. I also hear it's cool for light painting and taking long-exposure photos with.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
